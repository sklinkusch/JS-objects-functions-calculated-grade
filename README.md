# JS-objects-functions-calculated-grade

This webpage was created by Stefan Klinkusch at Digital Career Institute using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It takes an array of objects containing the name and the points, calculates the grade, adds it to the object and prints a table containing the name, the points, and the grade to the DOM.
